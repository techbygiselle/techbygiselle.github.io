        <h2>Why I prefer cats over dogs</h2>
        <p>I prefer cats over dogs because I'm lazy cats are lazy, it's the perfect duo. I actually have a dog</p>
        <p>and she is just full of energy and I don't want to get a dog and not be able to care for them like they</p>
        <p>need to be cared for. Cats don't need to go on walks, and that's great because I don't want to go on walks.</p>
